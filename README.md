# LongLineLasso
Find multiple matches in a GIANT line. Split an inconveniently HUMONGOUS line multiple times.

# Personal Motivation
I was given a GIANT 1GB 3 line json file.
The file didn't parse and there was no way I was going to find the syntax error in such a massive file.
However, I needed to interrogate that file to fix a bug.
