DONE pattern match and print 128 character context before and after
DONE option to adjust before, after, both context
DONE refactor to iterator so it can be unit tested (println makes it difficult)
DONE unit testing
DONE put together tests with gigantic files
DONE do match performance testing comparison with

DONE figure out how to do performance analysis
DONE tackle first performance bottleneck
DONE try assuming 1 byte per char. if that gets performance better than rg, that's
     good enough for now
DONE do split performance testing comparison with sed 's/pattern/\npattern/g'
	Even though we haven't fully optimized, we're better than sed. Nice!
- option to append after pattern instead of search for matches
- option to replace pattern instead of search for matches
- motivation
	- large files misbehaving in less and vim
	- grep handles it in a clunky way https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/163726/limit-grep-context-to-n-characters-on-line/548716?noredirect=1#comment1183864_548716
	- lets see how sed performs
- when to use this tool
	- 1GB lines
- when not to use this tool
	- regex
	- UTF-8: grep and ripgrep are faster
- how to install instructions
- release binaries
- share
- option to print character offsets of each match
